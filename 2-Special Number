Description
Professor Kishore wanted the kids to learn about Special numbers. (A two-digit number is said to be a special number if the sum of sum of its digits and the product of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 19 is a special number. The digits in 19 are 1 and 9. The sum of the digits is 10 and the product of the digits is 9. 10+9 = 19.)
Can you help Kishore to write a program to find all special numbers between 2 limits m and n (both inclusive)? Assume that m and n are two-digit numbers.
Input Format
Input consists of 2 integers m and n.

Sample Output 1
19
Case 1
Case 2

       t = t/10;

     {
       printf("%d\n",i);
     }

   return 0;
