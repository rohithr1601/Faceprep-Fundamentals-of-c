Description
Jaffer wanted to excel in Math. He was learning about the Kaprekar number from Meena, his Maths teacher. She gave him a few random numbers and asked him to find out whether they are Kaprekar number or not.
(Consider an n-digit number k. Square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits. If the resultant sum is k, then k is called a Kaprekar number. For example, 9 is a Kaprekar number since 9^2 = 81 & 8 + 1 = 9, similarly, 297 is a Kaprekar number as 297^2 = 88209 & 88 + 209 = 297 ).
Can you help Jaffer to write a program to find whether the given number is a Kaprekar number or not?
Input Format
Input consists of a single integer.
Output Format
If the output is a Kaprekar number print "Kaprekar Number" else "Not a Kaprekar Number".
Sample Input 0
45
Sample Output 0
Kaprekar Number
Case 1
Case 2
Input (stdin)
45
Output (stdout)

    s = n*n;
  	di = 1;
    for(int i=0;i<d;i++)
    {
      di = di*10;
    }
  	su = s/di + s%di;
    if(su==n)
    {
      printf("Kaprekar Number");
    }
